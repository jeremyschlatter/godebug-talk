Slides for my March 18, 2015 talk at [GoSF](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf/events/218203852/).

The slides are written for the [go present tool](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present). If you want to run them locally:

    $ go get golang.org/x/tools/present
    $ cd <this directory>
    $ present
